  comment = {This research gives a baseline of how many evaluations are needed at least to compare different algorithms.

This research claims that for EA the generation of next population is of parallel nature, unlike  traditional unerstanding, which says it is sequential nature.

Good expression:
Using a large offspring population in many cases can decrease the number of generation needed to find an optimal solution. However,  the number of function evaluations may increase as evolution can only act on information from the previous generation. A large offspring popultion can lead to inertia that slows down the optimization process.},

For an EDA to succeed in optimization, it is important that its model is changed over time in a way that better solutions are sampled more frequently. However, due to the randomness in sampling, the model should not be changed too drastically in a single iteration in order to prevent wrong updates from having a long-lasting impact.},

  title   = {SAFE: Scale-Adaptive Fitness Evaluation Methodfor Expensive Optimization Problems},
  year    = {2021},
  comment = {Key problem:
no matter the data-driven methods or the knowledge-driven methods, they
more or less make the replaced/simplified cheaper fitness function somehow different from the original objective function of the real-world problem (Surrogate is not the same as real function). This will unavoidably bring in model error which is harmful to practical applications.

this paper proposes a scale-adaptive FE (SAFE)
method to enable the EC algorithm to efficiently solve the EOP
DIRECTLY ON the original objective function

SAFE method is proposed to drive EC
algorithms to efficiently deal with the ORIGINAL expensive fitness

By using SAFE, the fitness function can be the same as or with no significant different with the original objective function, but the fitness value of the
solution can be evaluated in different accuracy scales by different EMs in different evolutionary stages to reduce the computational cost
