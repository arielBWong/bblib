  comment = {This research gives a baseline of how many evaluations are needed at least to compare different algorithms.

This research claims that for EA the generation of next population is of parallel nature, unlike  traditional unerstanding, which says it is sequential nature.

Good expression:
Using a large offspring population in many cases can decrease the number of generation needed to find an optimal solution. However,  the number of function evaluations may increase as evolution can only act on information from the previous generation. A large offspring popultion can lead to inertia that slows down the optimization process.},

For an EDA to succeed in optimization, it is important that its model is changed over time in a way that better solutions are sampled more frequently. However, due to the randomness in sampling, the model should not be changed too drastically in a single iteration in order to prevent wrong updates from having a long-lasting impact.},
